        (title
         (en "Guix-Science has migrated to Codeberg.org"))
        (body
         (en "The Guix-Science channel has left GitHub for a new home,
@url{https://codeberg.org/guix-science/guix-science}.  We felt that hosting
on Codeberg was more in line with our values---Codeberg itself is free
software, run by a non-profit, and does not use the repositories it hosts as
training data for its large language models.

As a user, please update your @file{channels.scm} files to refer to the new
URL.  As a channel author, please update the dependencies in the
@file{.guix-channel} file of your channel.

The repository at @uref{https://github.com/guix-science/guix-science} remains
available as an archive.  This means that references to previous commits at
this URL will still work.

Codeberg offers a workflow based on pull requests and an interface similar to
that of GitHub.  Please email @email{guix-science@@gnu.org} for comments and
questions."))))
